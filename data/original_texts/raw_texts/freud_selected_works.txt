SIGMUND FREUD - SELECTED PASSAGES FROM MAJOR WORKS

[From The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) - On the nature of dreams]

The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind. In every dream an instinctual wish presents itself as fulfilled. The wish-fulfillment is disguised by the work of censorship, which operates even during the state of sleep. What we remember of our dreams is only the manifest content; the true meaning lies hidden in the latent content, which must be discovered through analysis.

Dreams are not meaningless jumbles of images and sensations. They are meaningful psychological phenomena which represent the fulfillment of wishes that have been repressed during waking hours. The dream-work transforms the forbidden latent thoughts into the harmless manifest content through the mechanisms of condensation, displacement, and symbolic representation.

[From The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1901) - On unconscious motivation]

The forgetting of names is not an arbitrary occurrence, but follows discoverable laws and reveals the operation of motives. What we call chance actions are really meaningful expressions of unconscious thoughts and wishes. There are no accidents in mental life - every apparently random mistake, slip of the tongue, or forgotten appointment serves a hidden purpose.

These small failures of memory and attention are windows into the unconscious mind. They show us that we are not masters in our own house, that forces beyond our awareness continually influence our behavior in ways we do not suspect.

[From Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905) - On infantile sexuality]

The sexual instinct does not appear suddenly at puberty, but manifests itself from the earliest childhood through various stages of development. The child passes through oral, anal, and phallic phases, each characterized by the concentration of libidinal energy on different bodily zones.

The experiences of these early years leave indelible marks upon the character of the adult. Neuroses in later life can often be traced back to disturbances in this early sexual development. The child is not the innocent being that conventional morality pretends, but a creature driven by primitive instincts and desires.

[From The Ego and the Id (1923) - On the structure of the psyche]

Where id was, there ego shall be. The ego is not master in its own house. The mind is divided into three provinces: the id, which contains the primitive instincts; the ego, which represents reason and common sense; and the superego, which embodies moral standards inherited from parents and society.

The id knows no judgments of value: no good and evil, no morality. It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle.

[From Civilization and Its Discontents (1930) - On the price of civilization]

Civilized society is perpetually threatened with disintegration because of the primary hostility of men towards one another. The commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself is the strongest defense against human aggressiveness and an excellent example of the unpsychological proceedings of the cultural super-ego. The commandment is impossible to fulfill; such an enormous inflation of love can only lower its value, not get rid of the difficulty.

The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction. Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help they would have no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety.

[From Studies on Hysteria (1895) - On the talking cure]

We found that each individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and in arousing its accompanying affect, and when the patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put the affect into words.

The hysterical patient suffers mainly from reminiscences. These pathogenic memories, unlike other memories of their past lives, are not at the patient's disposal. On the contrary, these experiences are completely absent from the patient's memory when they are in a normal psychical state, or are only present in a highly summary form.

[From New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1933) - On the unconscious]

The ego is not even master in its own house, but must content itself with scanty information of what is going on unconsciously in its mind. We have learned that this unconscious mental activity is the true psychical reality; in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us as the reality of the external world.

The unconscious is the larger sphere, which includes within it the smaller sphere of the conscious. Everything conscious has an unconscious preliminary stage; whereas what is unconscious may remain at that stage and nevertheless claim to be regarded as having the full value of a psychical process.

[From The Future of an Illusion (1927) - On religion and human nature]

Religious ideas have arisen from the same need as have all the other achievements of civilization: from the necessity of defending oneself against the crushingly superior force of nature. They are illusions, fulfillments of the oldest, strongest and most urgent wishes of mankind. The secret of their strength lies in the strength of those wishes.

When I say that these things are all illusions, I must define the meaning of the word. An illusion is not the same thing as an error; nor is it necessarily an error. What is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes. In this respect they come near to psychiatric delusions.

[On psychoanalytic technique and the therapeutic relationship]

The analyst must turn his own unconscious like a receptive organ towards the transmitting unconscious of the patient. He must adjust himself to the patient as a telephone receiver is adjusted to the transmitting microphone. Just as the receiver converts back into sound waves the electric oscillations set up by sound waves, so the doctor's unconscious is able to reconstruct the patient's unconscious.

The patient must be educated to liberate and give up the resistances of which he is aware, and, as a result of the treatment, he often becomes aware of resistances which had formerly been unconscious to him. The aim of the treatment will never be anything else but to make the unconscious conscious.

[From Moses and Monotheism (1939) - On the power of the past]

What is forgotten is not extinguished but only repressed; its memory traces are present in all their freshness, but isolated by 'anticathexes.' They cannot establish contact with the other intellectual processes; they are unconscious - inaccessible to consciousness.

The archaic heritage of human beings comprises not only dispositions but also subject-matter - memory traces of the experience of earlier generations. In this way the past, the tradition of the race and of the people, lives on in the ideologies of the superego and yields only slowly to the influences of the present and to new changes.
