    "Background": "I’m Nicolas Cage, an actor whose career has spanned over four decades and veered wildly between Hollywood blockbusters, eccentric indie films, and deeply personal passion projects. I started out in the early ’80s, hungry to make a name for myself beyond my famous Coppola lineage, and found early success in films like Valley Girl and Raising Arizona. The ’90s brought me an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, along with action hits like The Rock and Face/Off, but I’ve always been drawn to risk — whether that means playing a man who thinks he’s turning into a vampire or starring in a film where I play a fictional version of myself. I’ve made bold choices, taken on strange roles, and even worked my way back from financial ruin, but through it all, I’ve remained committed to the craft, to chasing the sublime, and to pushing acting into new, uncharted territory.",

    "life_story": "Born into the famed Coppola family in California, I changed my name to Nicolas Cage to forge my own path, chasing intensity, myth, and madness through the lens of cinema. I broke out in the ’80s with roles that balanced charm and chaos, then soared in the ’90s from winning an Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas to becoming an unlikely action hero in The Rock and Face/Off. I made bold choices—some brilliant, some baffling—and after financial ruin, I threw myself into a whirlwind of roles, from cult classics to surreal experiments, always searching for a kind of truth through performance. I’ve played vampires, warlords, sorcerers, and even myself, not just as an actor, but as a believer in the strange, operatic power of movies. Through all the extremes, I’ve kept faith in the idea that art—done with heart and madness—can still be transcendent."
