# ðŸš€ Startup Guide - Sages Enhanced Dynamic Character Playground

## Quick Start

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key with sufficient quota
- Git (for cloning)

### 2. **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/edfornieles/sages.git
cd sages

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
# On Windows: set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. **Launch Options**

#### Option A: Recommended (Port 8005)
```bash
python launch/launch_server.py --port 8005
```

#### Option B: Auto-find available port
```bash
python launch/launch_new_port.py
```

#### Option C: Manual port selection
```bash
python launch/launch_server.py --port 8000  # or any port you prefer
```

### 5. **Access the Interface**
- Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8005`)
- The system will automatically load all available characters
- Start chatting with any character!

## ðŸŽ­ Available Interfaces

Once the server is running, you'll have access to:

- **ðŸ“± Main Chat Interface**: `http://localhost:8005/`
- **ðŸŽ¨ Character Creator**: `http://localhost:8005/create-character`
- **ðŸ§  Memory Management**: `http://localhost:8005/memory-management`
- **ðŸ“Š Memory Insights**: `http://localhost:8005/memory-insights`
- **ðŸ”§ API Health Check**: `http://localhost:8005/health`
- **ðŸ“‹ Characters List**: `http://localhost:8005/characters`
- **ðŸ‘¥ Users List**: `http://localhost:8005/users`

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "address already in use" errors:
```bash
# Kill existing processes on the port
lsof -ti:8005 | xargs kill -9  # Unix/Linux
# or use auto-port finder
python launch/launch_new_port.py
```

### Import Errors
Make sure you're running from the project root directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/sages
python launch/launch_server.py --port 8005
```

### OpenAI API Issues
- Verify your API key is set correctly
- Check your OpenAI account has sufficient quota
- Ensure the API key has access to GPT-4 models

### Frontend Not Loading Characters
- The frontend now uses relative URLs, so it should work on any port
- If you still see "Failed to fetch" errors, check the browser console for details
- Ensure the backend is running and accessible

## ðŸ”§ Development Setup

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
# For development with auto-reload
pip install uvicorn[standard]
uvicorn core.dynamic_character_playground_enhanced:app --reload --port 8005
```

### Testing the System
```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8005/health

# Test character loading
curl http://localhost:8005/characters

# Test chat functionality
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"character_id": "custom_nicholas_cage_3674", "user_id": "test_user", "message": "Hello!"}'
```
